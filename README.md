# go-httpbin

A reasonably complete and well-tested golang port of [Kenneth Reitz][kr]'s
[httpbin][httpbin-org] service, with zero dependencies outside the go stdlib.

## Usage

Run as a standalone binary, configured by command line flags or environment
variables:

```
$ go-httpbin -help
Usage of go-httpbin:
  -host string
      Host to listen on (default "0.0.0.0")
  -port int
        Port to listen on (default 8080)
  -https-cert-file string
         HTTPS certificate file
  -https-key-file string
         HTTPS private key file
  -max-body-size int
        Maximum size of request or response, in bytes (default 1048576)
  -max-duration duration
        Maximum duration a response may take (default 10s)

Examples:
  # Run http server
  $ go-httpbin -host 127.0.0.1 -port 8081

  # Run https server

  # Generate .crt and .key files
  $ openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
  $ openssl ecparam -genkey -name secp384r1 -out server.key
  $ openssl req -new -x509 -sha256 -key server.key -out server.crt -days 3650

  $ go-httpbin -host 127.0.0.1 -port 8081 -https-cert-file ./server.crt -https-key-file ./server.key
```

Docker images are published to [Docker Hub][docker-hub]:

```
# Run http server
$ docker run -P mccutchen/go-httpbin

# Run https server
$ docker run -e HTTPS_CERT_FILE='/tmp/server.crt' -e HTTPS_KEY_FILE='/tmp/server.key' -p 8080:8080 -v /tmp:/tmp mccutchen/go-httpbin
```

The `github.com/mccutchen/go-httpbin/httpbin` package can also be used as a
library for testing an applications interactions with an upstream HTTP service,
like so:

```go
package httpbin_test

import (
    "net/http"
    "net/http/httptest"
    "testing"
    "time"

    "github.com/mccutchen/go-httpbin/httpbin"
)

func TestSlowResponse(t *testing.T) {
    svc := httpbin.New()
    srv := httptest.NewServer(svc.Handler())
    defer srv.Close()

    client := http.Client{
        Timeout: time.Duration(1 * time.Second),
    }
    _, err := client.Get(srv.URL + "/delay/10")
    if err == nil {
        t.Fatal("expected timeout error")
    }
}
```


## Installation

```
go get github.com/mccutchen/go-httpbin/...
```


## Motivation & prior art

I've been a longtime user of [Kenneith Reitz][kr]'s original
[httpbin.org][httpbin-org], and wanted to write a golang port for fun and to
see how far I could get using only the stdlib.

When I started this project, there were a handful of existing and incomplete
golang ports, with the most promising being [ahmetb/go-httpbin][ahmet]. This
project showed me how useful it might be to have an `httpbin` _library_
available for testing golang applications.

### Known differences from other httpbin versions

Compared to [the original][httpbin-org]:
 - No `/brotli` endpoint (due to lack of support in Go's stdlib)
 - The `?show_env=1` query param is ignored (i.e. no special handling of
   runtime environment headers)
 - Response values which may be encoded as either a string or a list of strings
   will always be encoded as a list of strings (e.g. request headers, query
   params, form values)

Compared to [ahmetb/go-httpbin][ahmet]:
 - No dependencies on 3rd party packages
 - More complete implementation of endpoints
