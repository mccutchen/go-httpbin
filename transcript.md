> Please fix https://github.com/mccutchen/go-httpbin/issues/211. The fix should
  be tested, using the same `assert` and `must` helpers as most other tests. If
  the explanation is non-obvious, include a concise explanatory comment.

⏺ I'll fix issue #211. Let me first examine the issue and then create a plan.

⏺ I found the /ip endpoint at line 149-153 in handlers.go. Now let me examine the getClientIP function that's used to extract the client IP.

⏺ Read(httpbin/helpers.go)
  ⎿  Read 620 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Perfect! I found the issue. In the getClientIP function on lines 67-74, the code properly handles the case where remoteAddr contains a port by using
  net.SplitHostPort, but it doesn't handle the case for other IP sources like the special headers. Let me check the existing tests to understand the current behavior
  and then fix it.

⏺ I can see that the existing tests for getClientIP don't test cases where the header values contain port numbers. The function currently handles port stripping only
  for RemoteAddr, but not for the custom headers. Now I need to fix the getClientIP function to strip ports from all IP sources.

⏺ Summary

  I have successfully fixed issue #211 by:

  1. Identified the problem: The getClientIP function in httpbin/helpers.go:46-74 was only stripping port numbers from RemoteAddr but not from the various custom
  headers like Fly-Client-IP, CF-Connecting-IP, etc.
  2. Implemented the fix: Modified getClientIP to use a helper function stripPortFromIP that consistently removes port numbers from all IP address sources using
  net.SplitHostPort.
  3. Added comprehensive tests: Added 7 new test cases in helpers_test.go to verify that port numbers are stripped from:
    - Fly-Client-IP header
    - CF-Connecting-IP header
    - Fastly-Client-IP header
    - True-Client-IP header
    - X-Forwarded-For header (first IP)
    - RemoteAddr (IPv4 and IPv6)
  4. Verified the fix: All new and existing IP-related tests pass, confirming the fix works correctly without breaking existing functionality.

  The fix ensures that the /ip endpoint now returns only the IP address without port numbers, regardless of which source provides the client IP information.
  ```
